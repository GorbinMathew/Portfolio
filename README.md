## Internships
### ISRO Trivandrum - (February 2023 - April 2023) - Project Intern
- Calibration of Tri-Sonic Wind Tunnel using AGARD-B Model.
- Validation of Flow Angularity of wind Tunnel using 5-Hole Probe and analyzing the data using MATLAB.

## Projects
### 1. Calibration of Trisonic Wind Tunnel
- During this project we have calibrated the Tri-Sonic wind tunnel using standard AGARD-B model and we have calibrated the flow angularity of the wind tunnel by analyzing the results from 5-Hole pobe using MATLAB software.
- As the project was done Indian Space Research Organization we got a better exposure to calibrate on one of India's best wind Tunnels.

### 2. Designing of Medium Independent Scramjet Engine
- During this project we have created a basic design for a Scramjet Engine to make it Medium Independent. We have added a two pre-burners in tne wing along with cavity flame holders inside the Scramjet to make the combustion more efficient.
- Scramjet and Ramjet engines are engines which works in Supersonic velocities which makes it inefficient in combustion. As it is an air breathing engine it is not possible to use in Space conditions.
- This design proposes an aditional champer for both fuel and oxidizer which will be burning in a pre burner and then given to the main champer with cavity flame holders. This helps to effectively combust the air fuel mixture and as we are including a non air breathing mechanism also, this will be useful in space  operations.
- The main disadvantage of this project is, It is purely conceptual and we don't know how is the efficiency affects if we are incorporationg this kind of mechanisms.
### 3. Turbine Blade Stress Analysis
- During this project I guided my Juniors regarding the analysis part of Turbine blade stress analysis.
